1.Create table realEstate in Hive database, with all the columns present in dataset.
Also Load dataset into table realEstate.

Creating non partitioned table:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS real_estate(street string,city string,zip bigint,state string,beds int,baths int, sq_ft int,type string,sale_date string,price bigint,latitude float,longitude float)                         
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;


Loading Data:
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/acadgild/Downloads/real_estate.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE real_estate;

2.Using Dynamic partition give separate lists of residential apartments with more
than 2 beds. Also include columns in following order
City,Baths,Sq_feet,Price,flat_type,Beds respectively.

Creating a table:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS partition_real_estate(city string,baths int,sq_ft int,price bigint,type string)
    PARTITIONED BY (beds int)
    ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    STORED AS TEXTFILE;
    
Inserting into partitioned Table:
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE partition_real_estate PARTITION(beds) SELECT city,baths,sq_ft,price,type,beds FROM real_estate where beds>2;

Displaying From Partitioned Table:
SELECT * FROM partition_real_estate;
